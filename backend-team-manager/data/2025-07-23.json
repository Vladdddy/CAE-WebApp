I attempted to place the Oil Rig, but it didn’t appear either on the screen or on the map. I tried performing a total reset, but the simulator was stuck in reposition mode with the cockpit powered on (even though I hadn’t turned it on yet and engines and batteries were off). I attempted a full reload, but after reloading the session the IOS screens were no longer working. I tried reloading the Instructor + IOS, but we found the IOS PC was stuck. After rebooting it it worked, and I was able to reposition the entity. However, when I tried to activate the control loading, the errors 'controls abort request' and '24V safety loop relay disagree at CTL-1CPAD3U4' appeared. I tried resetting both from the IOS screen and from the MCL logic without success, and also tried power cycling the CPAD, again without success. I unloaded the MCL node, rebooted the PC, reloaded node, and it all worked",
