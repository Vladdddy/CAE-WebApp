# Admin Pattern Test Guide - Updated

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Pattern Application Logic**

-   **Old**: All users got the same pattern starting from the same position
-   **New**: Each user gets a different offset in the pattern cycle to ensure variety

### 2. **Weekend Notes**

-   **Added**: Automatic "Riposo" notes for weekend shifts
-   **Improved**: Better pattern distribution across users

### 3. **Month Clearing**

-   **New**: Red "Clear" button to reset all shifts before applying patterns
-   **Safety**: Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion

## How to Test the Corrected Pattern:

### Step 1: Clear the Month

1. Click the red **"Clear"** button
2. Confirm the deletion when prompted
3. All shifts should be cleared

### Step 2: Apply Admin Pattern

1. Click the green **"Pattern"** button
2. Select **"Admin Pattern"**
3. Click **"Seleziona tutti gli Admin"** (this selects Mario, Luca, Simone, Gianluca)
4. Click **"Applica Pattern"**

## Expected Admin Pattern Result:

### User Pattern Offsets:

-   **Mario (User 0)**: ON, OP, O, ON, OP, ON, OP, O, ON, OP...
-   **Luca (User 1)**: OP, O, ON, OP, ON, OP, O, ON, OP, ON...
-   **Simone (User 2)**: O, ON, OP, ON, OP, O, ON, OP, ON, OP...
-   **Gianluca (User 3)**: ON, OP, ON, OP, O, ON, OP, ON, OP, O...

### Pattern Explanation:

-   Each admin starts at a different position in the [ON, OP, O, ON, OP] cycle
-   This ensures that on any given weekday, admins have different shifts
-   All weekends are marked as "R" (Riposo) with "Riposo" note
-   The pattern repeats for the entire month

### July 2025 Expected Pattern:

```
Date    | Mario | Luca | Simone | Gianluca | Day
--------|-------|------|--------|----------|----
Jul 1   | ON    | OP   | O      | ON       | Tue
Jul 2   | OP    | O    | ON     | OP       | Wed
Jul 3   | O     | ON   | OP     | ON       | Thu
Jul 4   | ON    | OP   | ON     | OP       | Fri
Jul 5   | R     | R    | R      | R        | Sat (Weekend)
Jul 6   | R     | R    | R      | R        | Sun (Weekend)
Jul 7   | OP    | ON   | OP     | O        | Mon
Jul 8   | O     | OP   | ON     | ON       | Tue
...and so on
```

## New Features Added:

### 1. **Clear Month Button** (Red)

-   Safely clears all shifts for the current month
-   Confirmation dialog prevents accidents
-   Useful before applying new patterns

### 2. **Improved Pattern Logic**

-   Each user gets a unique starting offset
-   Better distribution of shifts across team members
-   Maintains the requested 5-day cycle

### 3. **Enhanced UI**

-   Clear visual distinction between Clear (red) and Pattern (green) buttons
-   Better button spacing and organization
-   Automatic notes for weekend shifts

## Testing Checklist:

-   [ ] Clear button works and shows confirmation
-   [ ] Pattern button opens modal correctly
-   [ ] Admin pattern selection shows correct preview
-   [ ] User selection works (individual and bulk)
-   [ ] Pattern application distributes shifts correctly
-   [ ] Weekends are marked as "R" with "Riposo" notes
-   [ ] Each admin has different shifts on the same day
